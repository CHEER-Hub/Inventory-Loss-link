# Inventory-Loss Link Module

The **Inventory-Loss Link** module is designed to integrate building inventories and hazard maps with the [CHEER-Safe Loss Estimation Model](https://github.com/CHEER-Hub/LossModel).

Before getting started, please read the documentation:  
ðŸ“„ [Inventory_Loss Link Documentations](https://cheer-hub.github.io/Inventory-Loss-link/Data_Fusion.html)  
This will help you understand the module and the required data structure to run the model on your dataset.
